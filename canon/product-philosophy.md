# FIApp v1 — Product Philosophy (LOCKED)

**Status:** Canonical / non-negotiable unless explicitly revised  
**Purpose:** Define *why* the product exists and *what it must never become*.

---

## 1. Core Product Thesis

FIApp exists to help people **build sustainable wellbeing through small, intentional behaviours**, guided by self-awareness rather than external pressure.

The core loop is:

> **Assessment → Insight → Small Practices → Daily Reflection**

Anything that does not strengthen this loop is out of scope.

---

## 2. Behaviour-First, Not Content-First

- FIApp is **not** a course
- FIApp is **not** a curriculum
- FIApp is **not** a content library

Content exists only to:
- clarify insight
- motivate action
- support behaviour

**The unit of value is behaviour, not information.**

---

## 3. Cognitive Load Is a First-Class Constraint

The app is intentionally designed to:
- limit parallel commitments
- warn against overload
- prefer depth over breadth

This is why:
- active practice caps exist
- warnings are progressive
- trial practices are time-limited

Mental sustainability is more important than theoretical completeness.

---

## 4. User Autonomy (Adults, Not Children)

Users are treated as capable adults:
- We **warn**, we do not nag
- We **nudge**, we do not coerce
- We **block only when system integrity or realism is at risk**

Hard limits exist to:
- protect behavioural realism
- prevent system abuse
- preserve meaningful metrics

---

## 5. No Gamification Dependency

- No streak worship
- No infinite score chasing
- No artificial urgency loops

Progress is:
- reflective
- cumulative
- personal

Celebration exists, addiction does not.

---

## 6. What FIApp Must Never Become

FIApp must never become:
- a habit-tracker with unlimited toggles
- a checklist productivity tool
- a motivational quote dispenser
- a “do more, always more” optimisation engine

If a feature pushes the app in these directions, it violates canon.

---

## 7. Canon Rule

If future decisions conflict with this philosophy:
> **This document wins unless explicitly changed.**
